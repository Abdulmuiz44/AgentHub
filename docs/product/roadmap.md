# AgentHub Roadmap (v0.1)

## Goal
Ship a minimal local-first platform foundation with one runtime, one skill system, one model gateway, one dashboard, and one trace system.

## Milestones
1. Root-level monorepo scaffold and accurate developer docs.
2. FastAPI backend with persistence-backed health/sessions/runs/catalog endpoints.
3. Read-only filesystem skill slice with workspace safety controls.
4. Next.js dashboard shell wired to `POST /runs` with clear run feedback.
5. Initial runtime loop implementation on top of current contracts.
